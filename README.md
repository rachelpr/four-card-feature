## My process

1. First I started by drafting on paper what the page should look like. This helped me visualize how to organize the elements on the page, which came in particularly handy with the card layout.
2. Second, I went through index.html and applied the appropriate HTML tags
3. From there I worked on styling the elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It is really useful to bring out some pen and a paper and start with sketching out how the page should look before building.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This helped me get a better understanding of flexbox.
